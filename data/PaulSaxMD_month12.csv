1331433686064132096,PaulSaxMD,"At this point -- no surprise. One lesson of the monoclonal antibody studies once someone with #COVID19 develops a brisk antibody response, they have no benefit. (Maybe harm.) Passive immunization would be great Rx if it could be given early in disease and as a pill! (Haha.) https://t.co/SpxpNl07eX",11/25/2020 03:05:02,19,4,51,2,False

1329446379333296129,PaulSaxMD,"Dear Journalists,
Please stop with these negative headlines on #COVID19 testing. No, not a ""100% safe"" guarantee. But a negative test is far better than no test, and we should be doing more (not less) testing -- especially if people plan to gather.

Dexamethasone (not targeted, cheap) in RECOVERY the only exception.

The immune system is complicated, folks.
