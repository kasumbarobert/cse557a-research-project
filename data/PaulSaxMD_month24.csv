1461758334533439489,PaulSaxMD,"Very hard to argue against these data, which look as good (if not better) than the original placebo-controlled trial. 6 vs 123 cases of symptomatic covid19.

These 3rd doses (boosters) work really, really well -- and they work fast! https://t.co/OE9qqAx1OT",11/19/2021 18:08:39,117,17,332,7,False
1461461551987113985,PaulSaxMD,"@LCalabreseDO @NPR @EricTopol @Laurie_Garrett Good insight. Am hopeful that studying long covid will enlighten us about other post-infectious prolonged illnesses, of which MECFS is a prominent example. Much overlap in these syndromes.

In settings with rising incidence (now) especially, benefits of 3rd dose outlined in this RCT: preventing covid outweighs the small risks of AEs.

Everyone is tired of covid, but as cold weather descends, it's critical that we:
- vaccinate
- test before social gatherings
- wear masks indoors https://t.co/PcH0nWIgiY",11/08/2021 11:32:49,74,13,235,7,True

 these RTV effects are short-lived -- different than rifampin. Have also faced this in HIV/covid pts, and been reassured the same. Since PAXLOVID given early, dex late, probably won't matter!",11/06/2021 10:03:01,0,1,2,0,False

With risky exposures, suggestive symptoms, and high community transmission, pcr better. https://t.co/cBsSXM4YJh",11/04/2021 01:06:50,0,1,4,0,False
