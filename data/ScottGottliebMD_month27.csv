1497949657426661381,ScottGottliebMD,Measuring viral levels in wastewater is emerging as a reliable and key leading indicator of the ebb and flow of COVID outbreaks as more cities and states implement this tool and the #CDC steps up efforts to create a national network for collecting and reporting these data. https://t.co/QUSJio1Q31,02/27/2022 15:00:03,28,16,159,6,False

1497596665410174977,ScottGottliebMD,Itâ€™s established that animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 can lead to viral mutations and spillback from wildlife to humans.

1497017850141184030,ScottGottliebMD,"#CDCs move to base its guidance on measuring hospitalizations for Covid, and not just the number of cases, is a sound step that will allow us to better target public health measures to risk. It reflects a growing wall of immunity thatâ€™ll hopefully diminish COVIDâ€™s overall impact. https://t.co/cHcijVmzWi",02/25/2022 01:17:23,56,116,395,26,False
