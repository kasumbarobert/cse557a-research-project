The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) is ~0.7%. 

Case fatality rate (CFR) for confirmed symptomatic cases was ~14% 

CFR in Iquitos is similar to the mortality seen with symptomatic COVID in hotspots that got overwhelmed (NY, Lombardy)",07/24/2020 12:58:48,6,3,10,2,False

71% seroprevalence, the highest reported so far i~ 333000 cases

But confirmed cases are only 14711 (4.4%)

This means even assuming major undercounting, a lot of COVID, probably 80%, as expected is asymptomatic. @DrSidMukherjee",07/24/2020 12:56:33,7,1,16,1,False

1) They have achieved the 70% seroprevalence threshold for herd immunity.

Cases have dropped now in the region, as expected.

Several studies now suggest that T cells reactive to COVID may be present even in persons without prior exposure to SARS CoV-2 suggesting presence of cross reactive immunity presumably from prior corona virus infections.
