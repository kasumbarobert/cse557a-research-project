1519174384086306818,angie_rasmussen,Okay I’m seeing a lot of “it’s COVID” in the comments and ffs READ THE ARTICLE. Most of these kids are too young to be vaccinated so lots of them (but not all) have had COVID. We can’t rule it out but it doesn’t mean it’s the cause. We still don’t know the cause. https://t.co/aPhLAZHFeh,04/27/2022 04:39:32,44,24,245,3,False
1519036613795401728,angie_rasmussen,"@kelseygru Your anecdote is not “odd,” nor is it evidence. Again, diet does not reduce susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19. Vaccination does.",04/26/2022 19:32:05,1,4,9,0,False
1518926825161994242,angie_rasmussen,@CartoonessToo The goal of this was not to brag. It was to share the results of my approach to not getting COVID while traveling to a work conference. Feel free to unfollow.,04/26/2022 12:15:50,0,1,7,0,False

Still COVID negative.

A layered protection strategy that starts with full vaccination works. https://t.co/pOoVQzuH58",04/26/2022 12:07:25,55,35,560,3,False
1518883658966392832,angie_rasmussen,"@gebirgsziege @EckerleIsabella @edyong209 So this is the idea that because COVID restrictions resulted in fewer exposures/less circulation of common respiratory viruses, children had no exposure and were thus extra susceptible to whatever pathogen might be causing this.

I suspect it's more complicated than this.",04/26/2022 09:24:18,0,1,8,0,False
1518880762329800704,angie_rasmussen,"@EckerleIsabella Exactly. And I can say that the cases in the US so far are from states with the fewest restrictions implemented for the shortest possible period of time. ""It's lockdowns"" is a grossly simplistic (and politically motivated) way of describing the COVID-era hygiene hypothesis.",04/26/2022 09:12:47,6,3,76,1,False

1517265527453929474,angie_rasmussen,@zeynep Who is “we”? Do you mean you? Do you have any affirmative evidence they were at any point doing all the BSL2 coronavirus work you suggest? From what I can tell you have zero evidence to support that claim. Zero.,04/21/2022 22:14:25,0,0,13,0,False
1517173417908346885,angie_rasmussen,"@Chris_Said @zeynep @Ayjchan But international standards, to be enforceable, will require treaties.

1517149974781341697,angie_rasmussen,"@zeynep @Ayjchan Most virologists—senior, on Twitter, in cherry-picked articles, or otherwise—now agree that SARSr-CoVs should be handled in BSL3 containment.

1517101297186582535,angie_rasmussen,"@AdotCrawley There's no one size fits all approach, which is why it's important that these practices undergo regular review.

1517054807919505408,angie_rasmussen,"@AdotCrawley Exactly. And while many IBCs did consider BSL2 adequate for working with bat CoVs prior to the pandemic, my guess is that now none will.
