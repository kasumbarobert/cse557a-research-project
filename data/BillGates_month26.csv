1483664088735514624,BillGates,The omicron surge is an unfortunate reminder that the only way to eliminate the threat of COVID-19 somewhere is to eliminate it everywhere.

1480977403270762496,BillGates,@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov A more transmissive variant is not likely but we have been surprised a lot during this pandemic. Omicron will create a lot of immunity at least for the next year. @trvrb  tracks the genetics really well.

1480974345585377283,BillGates,@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov From 2000 to the start of the pandemic we made strong progress on health and other goals.
