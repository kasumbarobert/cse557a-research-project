1470782061036380161,trvrb,@ktlmld Good question. Before Omicron I had assumed that Delta (and its descendants) were here to stay. This would occur through a combination of waning immunity and antigenic drift of Delta. Flu circulates every year with more of latter and seasonal coronavirus with more of the former.,12/14/2021 15:45:43,0,1,25,0,False
1470512018541010945,trvrb,"@brett7201 @truebloodnet @jingolfsson Flu vaccine won't protect against COVID and COVID vaccine won't protect against flu. The viruses are too distant. Flu vaccine never contains seasonal coronaviruses. The trivalent vaccine contains H3, H1 and one B flu. The quadrivalent vaccine contains H3, H1, B/Vic and B/Yam flu.",12/13/2021 21:52:40,3,3,14,0,False
