1448472151619616774,trvrb,"@Willard1951 The multiple flu valencies are partly due to pandemics introducing distinct subtypes that can co-circulate (A/H3 and A/H1). Separately, flu B/Victoria and B/Yamagata “speciated” around 1980.  I’d expect generally strain replacement for COVID, but flu B-like speciation possible.",10/14/2021 02:14:06,0,0,7,0,False
1448439571256016897,trvrb,"@akanoego I might suspect that mitigation measures we take for COVID (ventilation, staying home more often when sick…) could systematically reduce flu circulation by some modest amount. But this is pretty speculative. There should be little direct competition between flu and SARS-CoV-2.",10/14/2021 00:04:39,2,1,12,1,False
1448437914925363201,trvrb,@BakerMathis @AdamJKucharski It feels high doesn’t it? But we have seroepi studies suggesting 30% yearly attack rate of seasonal coronavirus due to waning immunity (https://t.co/EB0HU2efXh).,10/13/2021 23:58:04,9,4,55,0,False
1448436614082875392,trvrb,"@NdefoNkem Important point when thinking about morbidity and health burden. Just as risk of death is lower with prior immunity, evidence so far suggests that risk of long COVID will be lower with immunity as well. But certainly still a risk that should be understood and quantified.",10/13/2021 23:52:54,13,12,128,1,False
1448434276714758144,trvrb,@viget99 @juli_bg_bs @NRubinNHaven @MarcusBeam1 Take a look at Figure 1 Supplement 1 here: https://t.co/2VXT1nlkix. Plenty of recombination in seasonal coronaviruses. Not yet important for SARS-CoV-2 but recombination during endemic circulation will be occur.,10/13/2021 23:43:36,0,0,3,0,False
1448297978419101696,trvrb,"Together, this would suggest perhaps 40k or 100k deaths per year in the US from COVID at endemic state. Most infections would be relatively mild (just like flu), but there's enough of them that even a small fraction of severe outcomes add up. 15/17",10/13/2021 14:42:00,115,22,550,64,False
1448297965374803976,trvrb,"Waning immunity is a bit more of an open question. Although, other seasonal coronaviruses appear to cause reinfections every ~3 years (https://t.co/jDf34TnXoB), it's hard to completely extrapolate from these viruses to SARS-like coronaviruses. 8/17",10/13/2021 14:41:57,31,7,331,2,False
1448297962229088259,trvrb,"Broadly, I expect the eventual endemic state of COVID to be similar with substantial circulation but reduced disease burden relative to the pandemic state. The key parameters here include:
1. R0
2. Waning immunity
3. Antigenic drift
4. Infection to fatality rate (IFR) 6/17",10/13/2021 14:41:56,38,11,407,7,False
1448297955912568835,trvrb,"Here, I've been trying to think about what COVID will look like in its endemic state, ie once the (more or less entire) population has immunity to the virus, blunting transmission and disease relative to the pandemic state. 2/17",10/13/2021 14:41:55,71,5,376,19,False
1448297954306150401,trvrb,"I've meaning to write a ""COVID endgame"" thread for a while and I apologize this is somewhat delayed compared to media interviews like https://t.co/dQuo9i6ER7 and https://t.co/48MmCeq33g and to recent seminars like https://t.co/PGcgDinSNT. 1/17",10/13/2021 14:41:55,933,83,2437,305,False
1447723245835153409,trvrb,@ryanmhickman Yes. Coinfection by multiple SARS-CoV-2 viruses should be possible and mostly depend on general level of community transmission. We see evidence of occasional coinfection in seasonal coronaviruses based on observed recombinant viruses. Currently rare to observe for SARS-CoV-2.,10/12/2021 00:38:13,18,0,70,0,False
