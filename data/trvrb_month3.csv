1233240711350243328,trvrb,The broadening of #COVID19 case definition by @CDCgov is an extremely welcome update. I believe this strikes the appropriate balance. Testing capacity has to follow however. And auxiliary sentinel surveillance for mild cases highly necessary. https://t.co/2Tu6oBOG8Y https://t.co/qgp4RdYy6v,02/28/2020 04:01:12,69,8,146,5,True

1233221409410707456,trvrb,"This genome sits on a long branch without recent connections. However, this is similar to recent travel genomes collected during Feb. This pattern is occurring because only a small portion of #COVID19 cases are sequenced and so transmission chains are not fully sampled. 3/4 https://t.co/j3vK2cJbmJ",02/28/2020 02:44:30,18,3,64,2,True

1232868531475111936,trvrb,This is a possibility that should be addressed. #COVID19 genome sequences from a couple quarantined individuals alongside the sequence of the community case would readily resolve this question. https://t.co/Df5IocJiWT,02/27/2020 03:22:18,33,5,106,3,False

1. It appears there aren't massive undercounts of cases in China (https://t.co/MRXH6eu9Bb). This fits as with both my own phylodynamic analyses (https://t.co/fMUyNJdxJ6) and those of @erikmvolz (https://t.co/F0bbvNMdxg). 1/6",02/26/2020 02:31:26,172,9,253,33,False
