1362439959051862016,trvrb,@babarlelephant @nextstrain @CovidCg @firefoxx66 Very clever. I think that reference trees + phylogenetic placement of queried sequences from large database will be an increasingly relevant bioinformatic pattern as data  continues to grow.,02/18/2021 16:32:53,0,1,3,0,False
1362438599937982464,trvrb,"Increased transmissibility of B.1.1.7 will certainly stretch out circulation of COVID-19 and make it harder to bring under control relative to the non-B.1.1.7 scenario, but I'm not sure at this point how much of a spring B.1.1.7 wave to expect. 12/13",02/18/2021 16:27:29,71,14,416,5,False

1362433357359980544,trvrb,"@babarlelephant @nextstrain @CovidCg This is a really cool idea. @firefoxx66 has been running ""focal"" builds that pull in, say, all 484K sequences (ie https://t.co/EinhfX01IP), but very clever to be able to do this on the fly. Can I ask how you chose to add queried sequences to the your pre-computed reference tree?",02/18/2021 16:06:39,0,1,4,0,False
1360021984659132417,trvrb,@PeterHotez @fredhutch Thank you Peter! It's an honor to get to present to such an esteemed group of scientists. Fred Hutch has been a great home for virology research in general and I'm proud of the contributions the Center has made to combating the COVID pandemic.,02/12/2021 00:24:43,3,3,60,0,False
1357164916101115904,trvrb,"@austingmeyer @florian_krammer @edwardcholmes @LauringLab Definitely agreed, but we don't see a steep initial 1-2 years followed by a slower rate, which would be my ""abundant host adaptation in pandemic phase &gt; sustained adaptive evolution due to antigenic drift"" hypothesis.",02/04/2021 03:11:45,0,1,0,0,False
1357151598892310530,trvrb,@florian_krammer @edwardcholmes @LauringLab It would be great to have some general expectations here. My anecdote would also be with H1N1pdm where HA1 substitution rate doesn't seem to change much during vs after pandemic. This is the same plot as above just with x axis with real dates to make this more clear. https://t.co/umDc7qifl6,02/04/2021 02:18:50,2,5,22,1,True
