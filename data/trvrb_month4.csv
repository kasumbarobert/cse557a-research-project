1242827456475566080,trvrb,@Kathryn18724008 This flu virus called H1N1 continued to circulate seasonally from 1918 onwards and only died out when swine flu emerged in 2009. I haven’t been able to figure out why the 1918 pandemic had such higher mortality than subsequent seasonal circulation.,03/25/2020 14:55:30,17,12,111,1,False

1240526692377956352,trvrb,@Pinboard This is well put. I had previously shied away from location tracking for digital epi because of privacy concerns. My calculus has shifted with the pandemic and I now believe the societal benefits to connecting COVID status to location data outweigh the costs for the time being.,03/19/2020 06:33:05,17,10,103,1,False
