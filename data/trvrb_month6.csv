1261816514534977537,trvrb,I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the amazing team that have been responsible for @nextstrain and its work during the #COVID19 crisis. 1/11,05/17/2020 00:31:15,169,33,1362,19,False
1261471045862608896,trvrb,"@bonfamlio That was 0.03% of specimens from acute respiratory infections being COVID+ is consistent with our observation of 0 out of 3600 positive specimens (though note that 0.00% is also consistent). Not population prevalence, but prevalence in symptomatic individuals.",05/16/2020 01:38:28,0,1,2,0,False
1261468733572145153,trvrb,@JkMcBee That’s a hypothesis for the origin of (some) false positives. A recent seasonal coronavirus infection could (maybe) create antibodies that cross-react enough to masquerade as COVID in the assay. I haven’t seen this formally assessed anywhere however.,05/16/2020 01:29:17,2,1,22,0,False
1261459562181214211,trvrb,"@lindarobarge4 If the 4 of you got an antibody test this would help resolve. Assuming you didn’t have COVID-like illness in the intervening months, 4 positives on an antibody test would be very different in terms of the math here than a single positive as outlined above.",05/16/2020 00:52:51,5,1,82,0,False
1261376824770097152,trvrb,"Thus, it's possible that Jean had COVID in December, but it's much more likely to have been an asymptomatic infection in the intervening months. 7/7",05/15/2020 19:24:04,50,26,487,3,False
1261376824048672768,trvrb,"Given these probabilities, we can compare hypotheses under equal priors. We get a 9% probability of scenario 1 (false positive in serological assay), 89% probability of scenario 2 (asymptomatic COVID-19 infection) and 2% probability of scenario 3 (COVID-19 infection in Dec). 6/7",05/15/2020 19:24:04,36,10,287,5,False
1261376823117484032,trvrb,"In the third case, we know from @seattleflustudy work that 0 out of 3600 acute respiratory specimens from Seattle area collected in January were COVID-19 positive. A Bayesian estimator for mean prevalence would be 0.03%. 5/7

1261376822295408640,trvrb,"In the second case, we believe that the total attack rate by May 1 in Washington State was ~2% (https://t.co/O00Us6ELPl). If we assume that roughly 50% of infections are asymptomatic, this gives a 2% x 50% = ~1% chance of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection. 4/7",05/15/2020 19:24:04,18,7,122,1,False

1261376820718432256,trvrb,"There are three possibilities:
Scenario 1. False positive in the serological assay.
Scenario 2. A non-COVID infection in December, followed by an asymptomatic COVID-19 infection between Feb and April.
Scenario 3. A bona fide COVID-19 infection in December.
