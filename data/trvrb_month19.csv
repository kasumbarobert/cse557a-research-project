1401971800758624259,trvrb,"@NimwegenLab Great points. This framing of ""null"" can be seen elsewhere in the pandemic. Eg why was ""masks don't work"" the null that required significant evidence to reject? Similarly, why was ""vaccination does not block transmission"" the null?",06/07/2021 18:38:19,1,3,10,0,False
1400237544701259777,trvrb,"Regardless of COVID-19 origins, we should treat zoonosis and lab escape as potential pandemic risks and set up structures to mitigate these risks. On the lab side, this includes review of biosafety protocols and strong ""no fault"" reporting of laboratory acquired infections. 8/8",06/02/2021 23:47:00,238,75,1153,40,False

Though I'm not sure how to fully think about this one. A priori you'd expect a virus that causes a pandemic to have good human binding regardless of origin (otherwise a pandemic would not result from spillover event).,06/02/2021 03:10:51,2,4,21,0,False
