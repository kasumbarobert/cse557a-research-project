1418527422392279041,PaulSaxMD,"Superb, concise summary by @DLeonhardt of why Covid19 vaccine mandates work for both personal and public health. 

This is the right move, and one increasingly schools, employers, businesses should make.  @US_FDA approval can't come soon enough.

- employers
- schools
Some hesitant to act without this step. Including @MassGenBrigham, where I work.

Feel so bad for them that they didn't get the learning, camaraderie, and ""cruise control"" of senior medical residency -- then got slammed during first-year ID fellowship with more Covid.

If they're endorsing mandatory COVID vaccines -- along with the rest of the ID groups -- there's an extremely high likelihood it's the right move.
