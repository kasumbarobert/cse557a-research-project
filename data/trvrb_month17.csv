1386694473720025088,trvrb,"That said, there are multiple factors that should be resulting in continued improvements to the US COVID-19 epidemic (vaccination, continued build up of natural immunity from infection, improved seasonality). It's unclear to me how much of a wave from B.1.1.7 to expect. 10/10",04/26/2021 14:51:40,67,27,428,5,False
1386694440023068677,trvrb,There are effectively two #COVID19 epidemics in the US at this moment; one largely resolving epidemic comprised of non-variant viruses and one growing epidemic of B.1.1.7. Together they have resulted in a near-plateau of cases throughout much of the spring. 1/10,04/26/2021 14:51:32,653,38,1903,86,False
1382698537562091522,trvrb,"@TonyBurnetti @sarajean323 Well put. For flu, the common pattern is pandemic followed by seasonal circulation due to continued evolution. This is my expectation for SARS-CoV-2 at this point. Another seasonal respiratory virus thrown into the mix.",04/15/2021 14:13:15,3,1,20,0,False
1382490889742798849,trvrb,"@VerrethRebecca @chris60323690 I don't think we have the genetic data for 1918, but 2009 flu pandemic did not show this sort of remarkable evolution despite infecting 1/3 of the world in its first year. Generally some viruses are more antigenically evolvable than others, but I don't know what makes them so.",04/15/2021 00:28:08,2,2,19,1,False
1382379877609787392,trvrb,"@ScottVMeyers If true, I'd expect another seasonal ""flu-like"" respiratory virus to circulate every year. Pre-existing immunity will limit spread and disease, but there could be a ""COVID season"". Response should be vaccination (like with flu) not lockdowns.",04/14/2021 17:07:00,12,4,49,3,False
