1274836715438403585,trvrb,@pkarnezis @RogerGalligan @CDCgov Each age group is separate. In each age group it’s just “what fraction of tests were positive for COVID-19”? Essentially the middle panel divided by the left panel. It shouldn’t add up to 100%.,06/21/2020 22:48:52,0,1,4,0,False

1274144876376911872,trvrb,"With ""reopening"", we may see this trend in age distribution continue. This should ameliorate some of the health impacts of COVID-19, but will necessarily only go so far.

1274144871012397056,trvrb,"Here, I downloaded COVIDView data and slightly prettified their plots.

1274144869816995840,trvrb,"However, given what know about severity vs age, we really want to understand what's going on across different age groups.

1273762298121748485,trvrb,@MyMicroreact @CovidGenomicsUK This is really cool! I'm very impressed. I'm of course curious how you accomplished the performance improvements.
