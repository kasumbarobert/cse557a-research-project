Even pre-COVID, what masochist likes squeezing into a bodega that’s far, far over capacity to grab a snack or some chapstick or whatever, much less a bar or pizza place. Good luck trying to get a drink or slice. It SUCKS.",12/24/2021 13:58:30,0,1,12,0,False

Dr. Nash explains well in his thread that there’s still a lot of indoor activity associated with travel and the event. Ever tried standing in the cold for the hours it takes for the ball to drop?

1474378949232787463,angie_rasmussen,I completely and wholeheartedly agree with Dr. Nash for all the reasons he lists here. Let me offer another compelling reason that has naught to do with COVID: It SUCKS! https://t.co/eh4jxWMo33,12/24/2021 13:58:28,29,9,137,6,False
