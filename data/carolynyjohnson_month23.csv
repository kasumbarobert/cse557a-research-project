Training in science is like an apprenticeship - and they helped save the world as their first jobs out of college. This was their warm up. https://t.co/dApigNmz2y",10/02/2021 13:50:07,3,0,10,0,False

His interest in covid-19 is in creating a pan-coronavirus vaccine to prevent the next pandemic.",10/01/2021 17:24:36,0,1,3,0,False
1443990238582296579,carolynyjohnson,"One thing that becomes super clear talking to @WeissmanLab is a polite impatience.

He keeps getting asked about stuff that happened 15, 20 years ago. But covid-19 was the beginning, not the end of the medical potential.

1443914724710567936,carolynyjohnson,Graham's idea is that we shouldn't have to depend on luck. We should solve the 2 dozenish other viruses that might spawn a pandemic and have similar solutions for vaccines sitting on the shelf. Plug and play.,10/01/2021 12:24:31,3,2,14,0,False
