1453449538635763713,angie_rasmussen,"@nancykaffer So I reject the idea that vaccination only has minor benefits to kids. The benefits to them are tremendous, both in terms of protecting against COVID AND improving their overall quality of life at minimal risk to them, their families, and their communities.",10/27/2021 19:52:28,0,3,6,0,False
1453448778149675014,angie_rasmussen,"@nancykaffer Kids are at lower risk of *mortality,* but they can and do get severely ill from COVID. Furthermore, as you point out, having to pull kids out of school because of outbreaks is harmful in itself. COVID harms kids extend far beyond whether or not it's likely to kill them.",10/27/2021 19:49:27,0,1,7,1,False
1453448180109094915,angie_rasmussen,"@nancykaffer Finally, you bring up an important point about risk-benefit calculations. It's wrong to suggest that vaccination offers minor benefits to kids because they are at lower risk of COVID overall, or to frame this as kids need to be vaccinated to protect adults.",10/27/2021 19:47:04,0,1,3,0,False
1452662222845620225,angie_rasmussen,"@DougSReed @Lebeaucarnew @robparkinvideo Exactly. And to be clear, I'm fully vaccinated &amp; not worried about getting COVID. But our provincial health system is buckling under a huge wave (mostly unvaccinated). I don't want to contribute to transmission. Though my risk is minimal, the risk to my community isn't worth it.",10/25/2021 15:43:57,0,2,7,0,False
1452615004226785290,angie_rasmussen,@SamolejJ Yes the issue isn’t that I don’t want to see it in IMAX. It’s that with our current COVID situation it’s not responsible to do. I’m not worried about vaccinated me but I don’t want to contribute in any way to transmission while we are shipping ICU patients to other provinces.,10/25/2021 12:36:19,3,5,55,0,False
1452610480632221713,angie_rasmussen,It’s Monday and I’m still not over the fact that I can’t see Dune because it’s not available for streaming in Canada and I can’t justify sitting in a theater for 3 hours since Saskatchewan is to COVID what Arrakis is to sand worms and the spice.,10/25/2021 12:18:21,43,55,808,5,False
1451332625390522370,angie_rasmussen,@akelvinlab is an incredible badass scientist and colleague. I couldn't be more excited to watch this documentary about the amazing work going on here at @VIDOInterVac in Canada's Centre for Pandemic Research. https://t.co/O3dnBWGZGP,10/21/2021 23:40:37,3,2,20,0,False
1451167947003768841,angie_rasmussen,"Furthermore, this is fuel for the spurious accusations of the bad actors in this debate who have exploited this to further degrade important discussions about safety, security, and pandemic preparedness and prevention. The lack of disclosure perpetuates distrust.",10/21/2021 12:46:14,5,1,48,3,False
1451167945623756800,angie_rasmussen,"And this work is essential. Without it, we are less safe. We are less prepared for the next pandemic. Remaining silent and withholding data generated with public funds  violates the spirit and the goal of NIH funded research, which is to improve national health.",10/21/2021 12:46:14,3,1,55,1,False
1451167943564345355,angie_rasmussen,Yet I fail to see any situation in which withholding required data from NIH is justified. You can’t improve pandemic preparedness if you are hoarding data generated with taxpayer funds. That doesn’t make us safer. It isn’t consistent with EHA’s own organizational goals.,10/21/2021 12:46:13,5,1,64,2,False
1451167942419402759,angie_rasmussen,"I think EHA is subject to a lot of unfair criticism. Without their work, we’d have known even less about SARS-CoV-2 when it emerged. I respect many of the scientists at EHA and think their mission and work towards pandemic preparedness is critically important.",10/21/2021 12:46:13,2,1,43,0,False
1451167940443787267,angie_rasmussen,"I don’t do work that meets the P3CO standard for enhanced potential pandemic pathogens, but I do work in containment on dangerous emerging viruses. Compliance with regulations and transparency are essential to doing this work safely and ethically.",10/21/2021 12:46:13,5,1,54,1,False
