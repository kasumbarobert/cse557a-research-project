1441076631238373376,trvrb,"@ScottGottliebMD @HHMINEWS Thank you so much Scott. Itâ€™s been a trying and tragic 20 months for the world, but the scientific response to the pandemic has been unparalleled. Honored to have had the opportunity to play a role in it.",09/23/2021 16:26:57,7,7,141,0,False
1440776093389131784,trvrb,"The @fredhutch is recruiting for a faculty position in Infectious Disease Phylodynamics / Genomic Epidemiology. COVID-19 has pushed pathogen genomics well into the future and now is the time to advance research on methods/applications for sequence data.

1439325633192939524,trvrb,"@pjie2 @suvro1776 A couple things going on here:
1. The above S1 slope of ~4.4 is for the full pandemic span. It picks up in late 2020 (corresponding to the uptick in dN/dS).
2. And yes, per-site dS/dT is slower in SARS-CoV-2 than H3N2 influenza.",09/18/2021 20:29:06,0,0,0,0,False
1437543642147606530,trvrb,"@ChrisWeathers20 @BudvarCat @blue_proton It won't be like the pandemic. But I would anticipate a winter COVID season with decent levels of circulation, but with less severe disease due to individual's existing immunity.",09/13/2021 22:28:07,1,1,9,0,False
1437533682730893313,trvrb,"@RHPeel At the moment, yes. Katie's previous paper compared seasonal coronaviruses to flu showing rates of adaptive evolution of about half that of H3N2 influenza (Figure 6 https://t.co/YoJdoYyqBA). Here, we're showing SARS-CoV-2 significantly faster than H3N2.",09/13/2021 21:48:32,2,0,13,0,False
1437532543713120256,trvrb,@andrei_chiffa This work by @nicfelm shows frequent recombination in seasonal coronaviruses: https://t.co/xaXQ00eSqO. I'd suspect recombination to play a role in continued SARS-CoV-2 evolution by recombining novel S1 constellations onto ORF1ab backgrounds with lower mutational load.,09/13/2021 21:44:01,2,0,13,2,False

1437519286537318400,trvrb,"Focusing on S1, we calculate a common metric called dN/dS that compares nonsynonymous mutations to synonymous mutations. We find that dN/dS in S1 increases through time during the pandemic with the most recent timepoint showing dN/dS of ~2.1. 6/12 https://t.co/BPIK66a3EK",09/13/2021 20:51:20,33,5,107,19,True
1437519264525684738,trvrb,"We measure adaptive evolution by correlating mutations in different regions of the genome with growth of clade frequency.
