1331809962809389062,trvrb,@RELenski @COVID19Tracking This is definitely the worry. Temporary speed up in Nov and return to rate of exponential growth from Oct. We should see in a week whether this is the case or not.,11/26/2020 04:00:13,1,1,6,0,False
1331780073888776195,trvrb,"Although this is still a staggering amount of cases and growing daily, the rate of growth at the US level appears to be (at least temporarily) slowing. Here, I've plotted data from @COVID19Tracking, showing daily cases in the US on a log scale alongside 7-day moving average. 2/10 https://t.co/gZezHJlFMJ",11/26/2020 02:01:27,30,12,114,7,True
1331780066108338176,trvrb,"Another update on #COVID19 circulation in the US. With today's report we're seeing an average of ~172k daily cases reported compared to ~157k a week ago, and we're seeing ~1650 daily deaths reported compared to ~1200 a week ago. 1/10

1329659067988512769,trvrb,@pre176 @wapella @COVID19Tracking Yes. If it was somehow increasing testing capacity that was driving cases then we'd see CFR decrease. It's been quite stable since August.,11/20/2020 05:33:20,0,1,1,0,False
1329606226372489216,trvrb,@Trogdorburn @liamlburke @COVID19Tracking Yep. Dropped Hawaii for this reason and also dropped DC (a bit arbitrarily to fit into the grid).,11/20/2020 02:03:21,0,0,0,0,False
1329546639028064256,trvrb,The logic of the lagged CFR calculation is that a fraction of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 will succumb to their disease but that this takes time to occur and to be reported. We still expect 1.5% to 2.0% of cases to succumb and be reported 22 days later. 7/10 https://t.co/NtymVYZgpf,11/19/2020 22:06:35,19,4,79,4,True
1329546630987538433,trvrb,You can see this clearly by looking at daily cases from @COVID19Tracking on a log scale for each state. The solid lines show 7-day average of state-level case counts and the dashed lines show simple linear-on-a-log-scale fits. Straight lines indicate exponential growth. 5/10 https://t.co/h5FCsTpJGa,11/19/2020 22:06:33,37,4,119,16,True
1329546619906269184,trvrb,"When I ran these simple lagged case fatality rate (CFR) calculations last week I was surprised and troubled at how big the predicted numbers of deaths in the coming weeks were. Since then #COVID19 daily case counts have continued to rise. 1/10

1329304408622915584,trvrb,"@reichlab @youyanggu @IHME_UW I see that the IHME model shows 108,150 confirmed cases on Nov 8, matching NYT and COVID Tracking. However, with estimated infections CI from 155k to 270k with a mean of 215k. This is a detection rate of 40% to 70% with mean 50%. Seems high. 1/2",11/19/2020 06:04:02,1,1,7,0,False
1329239123631042560,trvrb,@youyanggu @COVID19Tracking This is amazingly helpful. I missed https://t.co/uTe0jCRFSv so much in its absence. Thank you Youyang for diving back in here.,11/19/2020 01:44:37,1,1,82,1,False
1329096822757888000,trvrb,@arambaut @1986Bom @Kevin_McKernan @BallouxFrancois @GuptaR_lab Actually revise “not personally upset” to mean I’d be more than happy to see data get used and analyzed (this is a pandemic we’re trying to science our way out of it). But the layer of SNature still ruffles careerism feathers.,11/18/2020 16:19:10,0,1,1,0,False
1328584235549134852,trvrb,"You can see that at 36 days after the 2nd dose, titers for binding and neutralization are often substantially higher in vaccinated individuals than individuals recovered from COVID-19 infection (labeled as ""convalescent""). 5/8",11/17/2020 06:22:20,24,1,148,4,False

1327998423958601728,trvrb,@JosephOnions @monkey_pasta @COVID19Tracking Yep. I believe this is mainly due to spectrum of disease. There will be a large number of mild or asymptomatic infections where people don’t seek testing.,11/15/2020 15:34:31,0,0,1,0,False
1327693029780557824,trvrb,@MRuizAravena Good points. We’ve basically seen no flu in the US so far this season. Almost all respiratory pathogens severely depressed by COVID mitigation.,11/14/2020 19:21:00,0,1,1,1,False
1327437386360373248,trvrb,If we don't take action soon the virus will decide for us. An eventual 30% of the US infected would correspond to ~450k deaths (at an IFR of 0.45%) and many more cases of #longcovid. 14/14,11/14/2020 02:25:10,328,69,846,56,False
