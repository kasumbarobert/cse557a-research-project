1254094865064812545,trvrb,"@DocJeffD @COVID19Tracking Definitely. There will also be large differences across US right now in terms of this reporting rate. I’d imagine modeling surrounding number of positives, proportion positive, deaths and serology to try to get at this across states and through time.",04/25/2020 17:08:10,0,1,15,0,False
1253880781702746113,trvrb,"According to @COVID19Tracking, the US is managing roughly 150k tests per day at this point. These 150k tests are finding about ~30k confirmed cases each day. However, I believe based on modeling results and serology that these have a 10-20X underreporting rate. 2/9",04/25/2020 02:57:28,148,11,461,10,False

1253453931948072961,trvrb,@akatradewind Yes. Age-stratification hugely important. But the 10X differential in IFR between COVID-19 and seasonal flu appears to be perhaps somewhat constant across age groups: https://t.co/44XgKaCe9k.,04/23/2020 22:41:20,12,1,88,3,False
1253436656742305793,trvrb,"We can compare #COVID19 1% infection fatality rate with an expected &gt;80% attack rate (R0 of ~3) to seasonal influenza with 0.1% IFR and yearly attack rate of ~10%. Simple math would put unmitigated spread as &gt;80X worse than a typical flu season.
